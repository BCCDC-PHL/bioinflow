"The genome of this pathogen and limited availabiliy of data. This bacteria has repeats, recombination, and resistance rolled into one! It cannot yet be cultured and those whole genomes that do exist publicly have limited associated phenotypic data such as macrolide susceptibility, which would help in predicting antimicrobial resistance." ~ Jessica Caleta, Genomics Liaison Technical Officer - NML/BCCDC

"The genome of this pathogen and limited availability of data - This bacterial genome has been growing my skillset in sequence typing, machine learning, syphilis research, long read analysis..I have enjoyed collaborating with the laboratory team as this project develops. The limited availability of data is also exciting because it means there is lots of potential to contribute to the field.‚Äù ~ Jessica Caleta, Genomics Liaison Technical Officer - NML/BCCDC
