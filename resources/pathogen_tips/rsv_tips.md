# What is the most challenging aspect of working with RSV?

## Laboratory Team

"Having a good strategy to subtype then sequence or sequence without knowing the subtype, that is the question. Also, balancing primers to sequence all the recent and relevant clades. The surprise RSV A/B duo positive samples: which way does it go? So many primers.." ~ Cindy Zheng, Technical Coordinator, BCCDC

## Bioinformatics Team

"Working with RSV subtypes A and B means everything has to be done twice while ensuring consistency across both." ~ Tara Newman, Genomics Liaison Technical Officer BCCDC/NML

# What is the most rewarding aspect of working with RSV?

## Laboratory Team

"Knowing that producing high quality sequencing data together with robust bioinformatic analysis output enable our PHL to identify mutations in viral genes known to confer resistance to monoclonal antibodies, and to inform possible vaccine escape cases.  It is rewarding to know our work will help to inform preventive and therapeutic interventions for the very young and older populations." ~ Cindy Zheng, Technical Coordinator, BCCDC

## Bioinformatics Team

"This was my first experience working on a project from the very beginning and it's been great to experience all the stages of development." ~ Tara Newman, Genomics Liaison Technical Officer BCCDC/NML
