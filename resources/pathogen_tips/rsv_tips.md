# What is the most challenging aspect of working with RSV?

## Laboratory Team

"Having a good strategy to subtype then sequence or sequence without knowing the subtype, that is the question. Also, balancing primers to sequence all the recent and relevant clades. The surprise RSV A/B duo positive samples: which way does it go? So many primers.." ~ Cindy Zheng, Technical Coordinator, BCCDC

## Bioinformatics Team

"RSV is double trouble â€” duplication is a recurring theme. Exhibit A: Working with both A and B subtypes means everything has to be done twice, requiring consistency across both analysis workflows. Exhibit B: There is both Clade typing and G Clade typing. Exhibit C: In 2016, a duplication event in the G gene occurred in both subtypes that is present in all modern lineages, making it important to use an appropriate reference genome for assembly."  ~ Tara Newman, Genomics Liaison Technical Officer BCCDC/NML




# What is the most rewarding aspect of working with RSV?

## Laboratory Team

"Knowing that producing high quality sequencing data together with robust bioinformatic analysis output enable our PHL to identify mutations in viral genes known to confer resistance to monoclonal antibodies, and to inform possible vaccine escape cases.  It is rewarding to know our work will help to inform preventive and therapeutic interventions for the very young and older populations." ~ Cindy Zheng, Technical Coordinator, BCCDC

## Bioinformatics Team

"This was my first experience working on a new pathogen/project from the very beginning and I've enjoyed getting to experience all the stages of development and learning ways to supplement our clinical data with in silico data to enhance clade representation in our datasets." ~ Tara Newman, Genomics Liaison Technical Officer BCCDC/NML
