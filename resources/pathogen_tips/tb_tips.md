# What is the most challenging aspect of working with TB?

## Laboratory Team

"The most challenging part of working with TB in the wet lab? Where do I even start? TB grows so slowlyâ€¦ or in clumpsâ€¦ or sometimes in flaky, stubborn little chunks. Really, TB just does whatever it wants, like that one unpredictable friend. Consistency? Never heard of it. And because it grows so slowly, getting enough high-quality DNA can be like trying to squeeze water from a stone. Which meansâ€”low input, all the time. Working with TB requires patience, something that most med techs arenâ€™t exactly known for. ðŸ˜Š
Now, the dry lab side? Thatâ€™s a different kind of challenge. The red screen of death!! Picture this: youâ€™re staring into the abyss that is Command Line, knowing your pipeline has failed. You dig through the code, only to discover youâ€™ve added a space where it shouldnâ€™t be. That moment of realization is... very satisfying." ~ Trevor Hird, BCCDC PHL Mycobacteriology TB laboratory

## Bioinformatics Team 

"The most challenging aspect of working with TB is wrapping my head around all the moving parts, especially the clustering. Setting up the process to test the outcomes of removing samples from existing clusters was complex. There's always something new to tackle around the corner but that also keeps it fun!" ~ Tara Newman, Genomics Liaison Technical Officer - BCCDC/NML

"Just when I think I understand the taxonomy of Mycobacteria, I realize that I do not understand the taxonomy of Mycobacteria. Also, we gotta bust these tough cell walls open to get the precious DNA out, but we also want long reads. No fair!" ~ Dan Fornika, Genomics Liaison Technical Officer - BCCDC/NML

## Leadership

"The TB bacteria is not a normal bacteria and has been hanging around for centuries.  The global world is trying to STOP TB and one day get rid of this bug.  The BCCDC Public Health Tuberculosis laboratory medical technologists team and the bioinformatics team have devoted over seven years to advancing the laboratoryâ€™s capabilities.  Their efforts have positioned the BCCDC Public Health Provincial laboratory in Canada to be the first to implement whole genome sequencing with improved pipelines on all new TB diagnosed cases." ~ Mabel Rodrigues, BCCDC PHL Mycobacteriology TB laboratory


"M. tuberculosis is a notoriously challenging organism, posing numerous obstacles - including in the genomics. These include difficulties with rapid data generation from liquid cultures, precision in correlations between genotypic and phenotypic drug susceptibility, and others." ~ Inna Sekirov, BCCDC PHL Mycobacteriology TB laboratory 



# What is most rewarding aspect of working with TB?

## Laboratory Team

"The most rewarding part of the wet lab is streamlining workflows to make them more efficient. Thereâ€™s something really satisfying about making the process smoother and more innovative while still delivering top-notch clinical results. The true highlight has been being part of building the TB Genomics Program and Bioinformatics pipelines from scratch. Watching brilliant minds tackle complex problems, collaborate, and innovate in real-time has been one of the greatest career milestones for me. Iâ€™m very lucky to have such an amazing team. And it's also very exciting to finally see people take a real interest in TB genomics now that WGS is in play!
As for leadership - it really shines when the lab's goals align with those of the leader. It makes transitions smoother, discussions more productive, and progress a whole lot easier." ~ Trevor Hird, BCCDC PHL Mycobacteriology TB laboratory


## Bioinformatics Team 

"The most rewarding aspect is getting to help the TB lab, working with the amazing team, and learning SO SO much in the process! Getting to solve the errors and turn the red screen of death back to green is the ultimate reward :D" ~ Tara Newman, Genomics Liaison Technical Officer - BCCDC/NML

"Mycobacteria, your slow mutation rate is a reprieve from the fast-moving world of microbial genomics. Youâ€™re the only microbe with a standard reference genome and I canâ€™t thank you enough for it." ~ Dan Fornika, Genomics Liaison Technical Officer - BCCDC/NML

## Leadership

"The integration of whole genome sequencing with the bioinformatics team is demonstrating tangible improvements in clinical outcomes.  This approach is enhancing the speed and accuracy of TB identification, predicting antibiotic resistance pattern, and relatedness of TB strains with the community, among health authorities and among specific individuals.  By leveraging whole genome sequencing with bioinformatics , a new pathway has been established in the laboratory setting, resulting in expedited TB reporting. These advancements signify progress towards our collective goal of eradicating TB in the future. TB doctors just recently expressed that the BCCDC Public Health TB Laboratory is now offering a 'Cadillac' services and we are so very lucky." ~ Mabel Rodrigues, BCCDC PHL Mycobacteriology TB laboratory


"Despite the complexities, the exceptional dedication of the PHLâ€™s bioinformatics team, including the highly skilled and innovative GLTO staff, has enabled the creation of a robust TB genomics program. This program delivers clinically actionable, highly reliable data on TB strains from both primary samples and young cultures. Our clinical and epidemiology colleagues frequently describe it as the 'Cadillac of services' in TB laboratory care."  ~ Inna Sekirov, BCCDC PHL Mycobacteriology TB laboratory
