# What is the most challenging aspect of working with TB?

## Laboratory Team

"The most challenging part of working with TB in the wet lab? Where do I even start? TB grows so slowlyâ€¦ or in clumpsâ€¦ or sometimes in flaky, stubborn little chunks. Really, TB just does whatever it wants, like that one unpredictable friend. Consistency? Never heard of it. And because it grows so slowly, getting enough high-quality DNA can be like trying to squeeze water from a stone. Which meansâ€”low input, all the time. Working with TB requires patience, something that most med techs arenâ€™t exactly known for. ðŸ˜Š  On the flip side, the most rewarding part of the wet lab is streamlining workflows to make them more efficient. Thereâ€™s something really satisfying about making the process smoother and more innovative while still delivering top-notch clinical results.
Now, the dry lab side? Thatâ€™s a different kind of challenge. The red screen of death!! Picture this: youâ€™re staring into the abyss that is Command Line, knowing your pipeline has failed. You dig through the code, only to discover youâ€™ve added a space where it shouldnâ€™t be. That moment of realization is... very satisfying." ~ Trevor Hird, BCCDC Mycobacteriology/TB Laboratory 

## Bioinformatics Team 

"The most challenging aspect of working with TB is wrapping my head around all the moving parts, especially the clustering. Setting up the process to test the outcomes of removing samples from existing clusters was complex. There's always something new to tackle around the corner but that also keeps it fun!" ~ Tara Newman, Genomics Liaison Technical Officer - BCCDC/NML

# What is most rewarding aspect of working with TB?

## Laboratory Team

"The true highlight has been being part of building the TB Genomics Program and Bioinformatics pipelines from scratch. Watching brilliant minds tackle complex problems, collaborate, and innovate in real-time has been one of the greatest career milestones for me. Iâ€™m very lucky to have such an amazing team.
And it's also very exciting to finally see people take a real interest in TB genomics now that WGS is in play!
As for leadership - it really shines when the lab's goals align with those of the leader. It makes transitions smoother, discussions more productive, and progress a whole lot easier." ~ Trevor Hird, BCCDC Mycobacteriology/TB Laboratory


## Bioinformatics Team 

"The most rewarding aspect is getting to help the TB lab, working with the amazing team, and learning SO SO much in the process! Getting to solve the errors and turn the red screen of death back to green is the ultimate reward :D" ~ Tara Newman, Genomics Liaison Technical Officer - BCCDC/NML
