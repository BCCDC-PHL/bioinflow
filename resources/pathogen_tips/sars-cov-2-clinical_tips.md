# What is the most challenging aspect of working with SARS-CoV-2 (Clinical)?

## Laboratory Team

"Keeping up with the variant names and updated lineages!!"  ~ Loretta Janz, BCCDC Bacteriology & Mycology Laboratory

"Managing the volume of samples."  ~ Rob Azana, BCCDC Bacteriology & Mycology Laboratory


## Bioinformatics Team

"Managing upstream metadata connections for redactions, uploads, and phylogenetic tree generation." ~ Tara Newman, Genomics Liaison Technical Officer - BCCDC/NML


"Pangolin lineages. If I wanted alphabet soup I’d go to the alphabet soup store. Also SARS-CoV-2, you’re the reason I have to answer my relatives’ strange questions after they “do their own research.” Nobody “does their own research” on Salmonella." ~ Dan Fornika, Genomics Liaison Technical Officer - BCCDC/NML

# What is most rewarding aspect of working with SARS-CoV-2 (Clinical)?


## Laboratory Team
"Watching the virus evolve and using the phylogenetic information to determine possible routes of transmission in healthcare settings."  ~ Loretta Janz, BCCDC Bacteriology & Mycology Laboratory

"Coming together as a team to sequence the most samples in Canada."  ~ Rob Azana, BCCDC Bacteriology & Mycology Laboratory


## Bioinformatics Team

"Working with the amazing team and supporting the routine analysis has been a favourite part of my week. It is also rewarding to be involved with the data sharing that currently occurs both nationally and globally with such a rapid turn-around time." ~ Tara Newman, Genomics Liaison Technical Officer - BCCDC/NML

"For a brief moment you made microbial genomic epidemiology the top story across the world. Thanks, I guess?" ~ Dan Fornika, Genomics Liaison Technical Officer - BCCDC/NML
