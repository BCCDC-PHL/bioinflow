# What is the most challenging aspect of working with influenza?

## Bioinformatics Team

"Why are you evolving and re-assorting segments so fast? Slow down, what’s the rush?" ~ Dan Fornika, Genomics Liaison Technical Officer - NML/BCCDC



## Leadership Team

"What ISN’T challenging about flu? Seriously. The reasons are TNTC (too numerous to count). For the dry lab, genotyping/reassortant classification. How do we account for all the rule-defying ways flu decides to swap one or more of its eight gene segments? In terms of wet lab, getting good results from nasopharyngeal swabs from skunks (haha! But seriously.). From the leadership side: Breaking down barriers to data sharing in order to advance One Health AIV surveillance and risk assessment." ~ Shannon Russell, Senior Scientist, Translational Genomics, BCCDC 

# What is most rewarding aspect of working with influenza?

## Bioinformatics Team

“At least you are not a pandemic – we’ve had enough of those. Please pick a species and stay there.” ~ Dan Fornika, Genomics Liaison Technical Officer - NML/BCCDC


## Leadership Team

"Generating high-quality flu sequences, implementing new tools (by brilliant genomics specialists) that improve our understanding of influenza genomics (FluViewer, FluFlo, GenoFlu, FluScan) and on the leadership side, getting to showcase the PHL team’s awesomeness — establishing ourselves as national leaders in this field (look how far we’ve come in 2.5 years!). Another rewarding aspect: Getting to use bird sayings when talking about bird flu challenges: 'don’t count your chickens before they hatch', 'let’s not ruffle too many feathers', but 'is it the chicken or the egg?', we could 'kill two birds with one stone' with that approach… :)" ~ Shannon Russell, Senior Scientist, Translational Genomics, BCCDC
