# What is the most challenging aspect of working with influenza?

## Laboratory Team

"Managing the variability that comes from different sample sources. Even though a standard submission process is in place 
for samples sent to BCCDC-PHL, different groups have varying practices (eg. sample naming) that need to be accommodated. 
In addition, human errors still occasionally occur and result in downstream linkage issues Harmonizing data from multiple 
sources. Sequencing data and metadata are received from different sources (BCCDC-PHL, CFIA, MAF, ECCC/CWS) by various means 
in differing standards and formats. This presents an ongoing challenge in processing and integrating the data to generate 
reliable results for multiple reporting streams." ~ Kevin Yang, Laboratory Liaison Technical Officer, NML/BCCDC

## Bioinformatics Team

"Why are you evolving and re-assorting segments so fast? Slow down, what’s the rush?" ~ Dan Fornika, Genomics Liaison Technical Officer - NML/BCCDC

## Leadership Team

"What ISN’T challenging about flu? Seriously. The reasons are TNTC (too numerous to count). For the dry lab, genotyping/
reassortant classification. How do we account for all the rule-defying ways flu decides to swap one or more of its eight 
gene segments? In terms of wet lab, getting good results from nasopharyngeal swabs from skunks (haha! But seriously.). 
From the leadership side: Breaking down barriers to data sharing in order to advance One Health AIV surveillance and 
risk assessment." ~ Shannon Russell, Senior Scientist, Translational Genomics, BCCDC 



# What is most rewarding aspect of working with influenza?

## Laboratory Team

"Seeing the tangible impact of our efforts in real-time. It’s fulfilling when the lab, bioinformatics, and surveillance
 systems we've been continuously developing and refining play a crucial role in enabling swift responses to influenza
  outbreaks and priority cases, such as the recent HAIV case."  ~ Kevin Yang, Laboratory Liaison Technical Officer, NML/BCCDC

## Bioinformatics Team

“At least you are not a pandemic – we’ve had enough of those. Please pick a species and stay there.” ~ Dan Fornika, 
Genomics Liaison Technical Officer - NML/BCCDC

## Leadership Team

"Generating high-quality flu sequences, implementing new tools (by brilliant genomics specialists) that improve our
 understanding of influenza genomics (FluViewer, FluFlo, GenoFlu, FluScan) and on the leadership side, getting to 
 showcase the PHL team’s awesomeness — establishing ourselves as national leaders in this field (look how far we’ve come 
 in 2.5 years!). Another rewarding aspect: Getting to use bird sayings when talking about bird flu challenges: 'don’t 
 count your chickens before they hatch', 'let’s not ruffle too many feathers', but 'is it the chicken or the egg?', we 
 could 'kill two birds with one stone' with that approach… :)" ~ Shannon Russell, Senior Scientist, Translational Genomics, BCCDC
