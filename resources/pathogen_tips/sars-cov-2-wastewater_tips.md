# What is the most challenging aspect of working with SARS-CoV-2 (Wastewater)?

"Binning SARS-CoV-2 lineages for visualization in an automated, epidemiologically relevant way was one of the biggest
challenges. Also, the validation because of the diversity of samples, data types measured, and questions to be answered."

# What is most rewarding aspect of working with SARS-CoV-2 (Wastewater)?

## Bioinformatics Team

"The most rewarding aspect of working with SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater is having a successful routine wastewater WGS 
surveillance system in BC! It has been gratifying to watch the cogs come together in the past 2 years and have contributed. 
There were many moving parts like partnerships established by the leadership team with Health Authorities + 
YVR International airport + the National Microbiology Laboratory, continued efforts in sampling, the processing of a complex 
environmental sample by the lab team, and the development of bioinformatic analyses to interpret the dynamics of infection 
in the population. I appreciated the opportunity to establish the bioinformatic side from start to finish - though it is 
an ever-evolving project!" ~ Jessica Caleta, Genomics Liaison Technical Officer - NML/BCCDC
